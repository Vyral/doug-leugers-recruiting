        <title>What’s Happening in the Housing Market?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/55tm-pByY0c?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center; font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Here’s what you need to know about our crazy housing market. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I want to speak with you about what’s happening in our market. As we head further into the year, things are just getting crazier and crazier. What does it all mean for you? Let’s talk about it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With inflation rising, many people are worried about their finances. &lt;strong&gt;Fortunately, real estate is a great hedge against inflation.&lt;/strong&gt; If you check out the chart at 0:22 in the video, you’ll see that home appreciation has outpaced inflation in nearly every decade since the 1970s. If you want to protect your wealth, putting it into housing is a safe bet. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what about home prices? The chart at 0:56 shows how much the experts think home prices will appreciate by 2026. Even the most pessimistic predictions say the average house will increase in value by 23.7%. Meanwhile, the optimists believe they could go up by 62.5%!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status= Even the most pessimistic predictions say the average house will appreciate 23.7% by 2026.%20http://localhost:4000/whats-happening-in-the-housing-market.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“ Even the most pessimistic predictions say the average house will appreciate 23.7% by 2026.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These predictions corroborate the latest data from Fort Myers and Cape Coral. The median sales price has increased by 26% from last year, up to $413,500. Meanwhile, our supply is as low as ever. Our active inventory has decreased 31% from last year, and closed sales are down 10%. &lt;strong&gt;Our market is still hot, so if you’re looking to sell, you’re in luck.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, what’s happening with interest rates? If you look at the chart at 2:22 in the video, you can see how interest rates are predicted to rise for the next four quarters. According to the National Association of Realtors, interest rates could be at 4% by the beginning of 2023. This means the affordability for buyers will decrease, and demand could fall as a result. Home prices will still increase, just not at the rate they are now. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about this market update, please call or email me. I’d love to help!  &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>3 Tips To Increase Conversion &amp; Organize Your Database</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/QnU8TocF2gM?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center; font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Today we’ll share our top three tips to help you maximize your CRM. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leads aren’t cheap- we spend lots of money on leads to convert them. So how do the top agents and teams in the country prioritize their database to ensure maximum conversion? Here are our top three tips:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Prioritize your leads by placing them in three categories:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Category one- Brand-new leads. Prioritize new leads in your database that you haven’t even attempted to reach out to yet. Ideally, you’d pick up the phone and call them as soon as they register on your website. That increases your chances of converting that lead. Remember that people often register on multiple websites, so if you don’t get them on the phone as soon as possible, other agents will be happy to do it for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Category two- Leads from the last 14 days. For these leads, contact them consistently and often. We have leads that have been in our database for years, and we still get conversions out of them because we never give up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Category three- Leads that have logged into the database most recently. We hit these leads hard because leads are the hottest when they are currently looking at listings. Leads can sometimes disappear for months before logging back in; just make sure that when they do, you catch them ASAP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status= After you’ve identified a lead’s three w's, schedule a reminder to follow up with them every 30 days.%20http://localhost:4000/3-tips-to-increase-conversion-organize-your-database.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“ After you’ve identified a lead’s three w’s, schedule a reminder to follow up with them every 30 days.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Take great notes.&lt;/strong&gt; If a co-worker were to win the lottery and never come back to work, you should be able to look at their lead notes in the CRM and pick up where they left off. There’s no sense in starting over with each lead and having the same conversations over again. Be sure to write down their ‘why,’ ‘when,’ and ‘what’ so that you or your team know what’s most important to that lead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Follow up.&lt;/strong&gt; Many people drop the ball when it comes to this, but there’s gold in the follow-up. After you’ve had a conversation with the lead and identified their three w’s, schedule a reminder to follow up with them every 30 days. Most of our leads are years out from buying or selling, but we don’t want them to forget about us in the meantime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about today’s tips or anything else to do with maximizing your real estate business, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We’d love to hear from you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How To Engage Your Database</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Di3qmg62G3M?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center; font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Here's how reaching out to your database will increase your business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today we’ll talk about how to engage your database and sphere of influence to get more business in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting referrals from your sphere of influence is huge because those are people that already know you, like you, and trust you. The difference between your sphere of influence and buyer or seller leads is that they’re registering on many different websites and are getting chased by other Realtors. You should have leads coming in from different sources, and you should be chasing them.&lt;strong&gt; Working your sphere of influence will help maximize your business in 2022.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve put together an awesome script for you to use and engage your database periodically. It’s really simple—it’s not designed to ask your sphere of influence for referral business; instead, it lets them know that you’re thinking about them and that you care. Those two things tend to naturally spark conversations about real estate. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Getting referrals from your sphere of influence is huge.%20http://localhost:4000/how-to-engage-your-database.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Getting referrals from your sphere of influence is huge.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the script:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1. Hi (Client Name), I was just thinking of you and wanted to check in. How are you? (and family)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2. How are things with your home? Do you need any referrals to contractors, handymen etc? Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3. When you get a moment, please let me know how you are doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We recommend that you use this script on Facebook Messenger so that you can see if they got your video and whether they watched it. Don’t worry if you don’t get a reply; the point is to just reach out and let them know you’re thinking of them. Do that periodically but consistently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions, visit our website, and don’t hesitate to reach out to us by phone or email. We look forward to hearing from you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Picture Your Goals With Vision Boards</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/TtpOliB_Zac?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center; font-style:italic;&quot;&gt; Here’s why you should use vision boards to visualize your goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we move through the last quarter of the year, now is the time to evaluate your book of business and ask what you did well on and where you could improve. You want to set your goals for next year and plan how you are going to meet them. If you don’t have a target, you don’t know what you’re aiming for. We wanted to share with you a powerful tool to help you visualize that target: vision boards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feel free to watch the full message above, or skip to topics that interest you using the timestamps provided below:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;0:35 — Vision boards&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1:23 — What makes vision boards so powerful?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2:26 — Take time to focus on your vision board every day&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3:31 — How we use vision boards&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4:12 — What you can put on your board&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4:54 — Some books on this topic&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5:18 — Wrapping up&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hope these practices help you meet all of your goals this next year. We want to be a resource for you too, so if you have any questions, feel free to give us a call.&lt;/p&gt;
