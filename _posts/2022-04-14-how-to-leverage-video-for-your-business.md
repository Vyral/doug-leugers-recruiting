Do you have a video presence to market your business? If you do, are you uncomfortable being on camera? If so, you’re not alone, we were at the beginning too. Then we realized that to truly level up our business, we had to get comfortable with being uncomfortable, get in front of the camera, and just do it. As a result, in 2019, we were featured in Florida Realtor Magazine and recognized for our real estate lifestyle videos.&nbsp;

Through plenty of trial and error over the years, we learned how to leverage video to maximize our business. Whether you’re considering launching a YouTube channel, shooting reels, or just sending video text messages, here are the top four tips you need to know to create a successful video:

**1\. Have a great title or caption.** This is your hook to get people curious about what you have to say.&nbsp;

**2\. Consider the thumbnail.** The thumbnail is your first impression, and first impressions matter. The thumbnail is so crucial that it can be the difference between your video going viral or not.&nbsp;

**3\. Bring the value.** People want market stats, local insights, and to know that you’re the expert they can trust. Deliver solid value in your content every time, and your audience will be eager to receive your updates.&nbsp;

**4\. Close with a call to action.** For example: “If you want to learn more about buying, selling, or building a home here in Fort Myers, visit our website, or call, text, or email us at (insert your email here).”

**Bonus tip:** Don’t wait for everything to be perfect to get started. Try not to worry about people judging you. Focus on progress, not perfection.&nbsp;
