Today I want to speak with you about what’s happening in our market. As we head further into the year, things are just getting crazier and crazier. What does it all mean for you? Let’s talk about it.&nbsp;

With inflation rising, many people are worried about their finances. **Fortunately, real estate is a great hedge against inflation.** If you check out the chart at 0:22 in the video, you’ll see that home appreciation has outpaced inflation in nearly every decade since the 1970s. If you want to protect your wealth, putting it into housing is a safe bet.&nbsp;

So what about home prices? The chart at 0:56 shows how much the experts think home prices will appreciate by 2026. Even the most pessimistic predictions say the average house will increase in value by 23.7%. Meanwhile, the optimists believe they could go up by 62.5%\!

These predictions corroborate the latest data from Fort Myers and Cape Coral. The median sales price has increased by 26% from last year, up to $413,500. Meanwhile, our supply is as low as ever. Our active inventory has decreased 31% from last year, and closed sales are down 10%. **Our market is still hot, so if you’re looking to sell, you’re in luck.**

Finally, what’s happening with interest rates? If you look at the chart at 2:22 in the video, you can see how interest rates are predicted to rise for the next four quarters. According to the National Association of Realtors, interest rates could be at 4% by the beginning of 2023. This means the affordability for buyers will decrease, and demand could fall as a result. Home prices will still increase, just not at the rate they are now.&nbsp;
