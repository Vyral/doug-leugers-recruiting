As we move through the last quarter of the year, now is the time to evaluate your book of business and ask what you did well on and where you could improve. You want to set your goals for next year and plan how you are going to meet them. If you don’t have a target, you don’t know what you’re aiming for. We wanted to share with you a powerful tool to help you visualize that target: vision boards.
