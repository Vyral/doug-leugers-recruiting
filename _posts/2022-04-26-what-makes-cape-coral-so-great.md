Do you know about Cape Coral? It’s one of the most desirable locations in Florida, and today we want to highlight what makes it so special.&nbsp;

Cape Coral has consistently been showing up in Forbes’ list of top 10 real estate markets in the U.S. for several years, and this year is no different. **As the eighth best market in the country, Cape Coral is a hot destination for people from all over the world.** Founded in 1957 as a waterfront wonderland, this area was mostly swampland until savvy investors laid plans for its future.&nbsp;

Cape Coral was designed to be a boater’s paradise, so it’s home to over 400 canals. That’s more than Venice, Italy\! The Cape is home to fantastic fishing and boating opportunities, but if that isn’t enough for you, **we want to break down five reasons why people love this area:**

1\. Prices are lower than other waterfront cities

2\. The climate allows you to enjoy outdoor activities all year round

3\. Biking and walking trails are all around

4\. Proximity to other Florida beaches and attractions

5\. Small town vibes combined with big town amenities

As a final note, it’s also very easy to travel to Cape Coral. It’s close to several international airports. If you want to make the dream of living in Florida a reality, we recommend you act fast. Prices rose 36.5% last year, and now that the secret is out, they won’t be coming down anytime soon.
