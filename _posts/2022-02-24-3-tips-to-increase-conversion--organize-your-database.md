Leads aren’t cheap- we spend lots of money on leads to convert them. So how do the top agents and teams in the country prioritize their database to ensure maximum conversion? Here are our top three tips:

**1\. Prioritize your leads by placing them in three categories:**

Category one- Brand-new leads. Prioritize new leads in your database that you haven’t even attempted to reach out to yet. Ideally, you’d pick up the phone and call them as soon as they register on your website. That increases your chances of converting that lead. Remember that people often register on multiple websites, so if you don’t get them on the phone as soon as possible, other agents will be happy to do it for you.

Category two- Leads from the last 14 days. For these leads, contact them consistently and often. We have leads that have been in our database for years, and we still get conversions out of them because we never give up.

Category three- Leads that have logged into the database most recently. We hit these leads hard because leads are the hottest when they are currently looking at listings. Leads can sometimes disappear for months before logging back in; just make sure that when they do, you catch them ASAP.

**2\. Take great notes.** If a co-worker were to win the lottery and never come back to work, you should be able to look at their lead notes in the CRM and pick up where they left off. There’s no sense in starting over with each lead and having the same conversations over again. Be sure to write down their ‘why,’ ‘when,’ and ‘what’ so that you or your team know what’s most important to that lead.

**3\. Follow up.** Many people drop the ball when it comes to this, but there’s gold in the follow-up. After you’ve had a conversation with the lead and identified their three w's, schedule a reminder to follow up with them every 30 days. Most of our leads are years out from buying or selling, but we don’t want them to forget about us in the meantime.

If you have any questions about today’s tips or anything else to do with maximizing your real estate business, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We’d love to hear from you.
