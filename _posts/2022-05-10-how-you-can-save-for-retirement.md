If you stopped selling homes today, how much money would you need to make to sustain your lifestyle? How much money will you need each month when you retire someday? Today we're talking about the Freedom Formula, which every agent needs to know, but few do:

$900,000 x 4% = $36,000

$36,000 / 12 = $3,000

**The Freedom Formula is what financial advisors say you need to have saved in the bank**&nbsp;to be able to retire someday. You need to have $900,000 in the bank after taxes, and every year, you can withdraw 4% of it for $36,000 in yearly income or $3,000 in monthly income.

We know what you’re thinking. That $3,000 a month won’t even pay your current bills, let alone the bills you’ll have to pay in the future. Out of the 10,000 or more Realtors we’ve coached over the years, **not very many of them had that money in the bank.&nbsp;**

The real estate model is broken, and as we see it, you have two choices: save $900,000 after taxes or work until you die. If neither of those options sounds sexy, there is a third one, and **we’d be happy to walk you through it.**
