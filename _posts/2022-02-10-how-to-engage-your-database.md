Today we'll talk about how to engage your database and sphere of influence to get more business in 2022.

Getting referrals from your sphere of influence is huge because those are people that already know you, like you, and trust you. The difference between your sphere of influence and buyer or seller leads is that they’re registering on many different websites and are getting chased by other Realtors. You should have leads coming in from different sources, and you should be chasing them.**&nbsp;Working your sphere of influence will help maximize your business in 2022.**

We’ve put together an awesome script for you to use and engage your database periodically. It’s really simple—it’s not designed to ask your sphere of influence for referral business; instead, it lets them know that you’re thinking about them and that you care. Those two things tend to naturally spark conversations about real estate.&nbsp;

Here is the script:

1\. Hi (Client Name), I was just thinking of you and wanted to check in. How are you? (and family)

2\. How are things with your home? Do you need any referrals to contractors, handymen etc? Please don't hesitate to reach out if you do.

3\. When you get a moment, please let me know how you are doing.

We recommend that you use this script on Facebook Messenger so that you can see if they got your video and whether they watched it. Don't worry if you don't get a reply; the point is to just reach out and let them know you're thinking of them. Do that periodically but consistently.

If you have any questions, visit our website, and don’t hesitate to reach out to us by phone or email. We look forward to hearing from you.
